                        <p class="about__bio-text">The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
                            California. The band consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist Mack Tolkens,
                            guitarist
                            Andrew Green, bassist Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The band achieved its first
                            commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing attention from manager Cam Adams. Having
                            worked
                            with other popular acts (The Elephant In The Room, One Trick Pony, The Cat’s Meow), Adams
                            was
                            confident the band could succeed even further, pushing them to sign with Magenta Records.
                        </p>

                        <p class="about__bio-text">From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition
                            and
                            ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell in love with the
                            band’s
                            original and organic attitude, solidifying their place as one of the hottest and fastest up
                            and
                            coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are
                            drawn
                            to their candid and authentic performances on stage. Looking forward to touring in the
                            future,
                            The Bees Knees are currently recording their second studio album, looking to be released in
                            late
                            2021.</p>
