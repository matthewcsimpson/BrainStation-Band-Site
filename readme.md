- When adding the file path for your @font-face rule src url, this should be the relative path from the css file linked in your HTML. VSCode is smart enough to ignore the extra step back in the directory, but might cause an issue loading fonts when you host your own websites in the future. ✅

- Consider space out elements in the footer on mobile size to match the mockup.
- Try to make the footer logo smaller on tablet size and desktop size to match the mockup.
- Consider having a separate typefaces partial for your typefaces for best practice. ✅
- Consider linking the logo/wordmark to return a user to the Biography page as listed in the project requirement. ✅
- Ensure to remove commented out code, or code that is not being used anywhere before submission. ✅
